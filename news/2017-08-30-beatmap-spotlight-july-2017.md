A marathon difficulty which happens to be under 4 stars and is mapped with the delightful russian mapping-style we all love and know can be found in this map. **(Mirash)[https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2841009]** has done an excellent job in keeping all elements in mind when mapping this song - the background rhythm, the vocals and the instruments. With careful placement and neat accentuation Mirash has succeeded in offering the community a map which can be enjoyed by many people.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/zauberkugel.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/554892)

Yet again. **(pishifat)[https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3178418]** manages to impress the community with a map in this month's spotlights. Zaberkugel heavily focuses on slider speed changes as the song progresses. Combining with creative slider arrangements and great gameplay overall make this one a must-play!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/sayonara-heaven.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/516995)

With such clean and consistent mapping, **(jieusieu)[https://osu.ppy.sh/u/759439]**, **(Beomsan)[https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3626063]** and **(Enon)[https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2043401]** managed to create a wonderful mapset worthy of this month's Spotlight.

Each difficulty captures the song wonderfully while also putting attention to the breaks in the music, and the map itself flows brilliantly, topped off with some excellent and beatifully fitting hitsounding.

Not only that, this mapset also contains a fantastic storyboard by someone who decided to remain anonymous. Definitely worth giving this mapset a try which maintains a gradual difficulty spread for players of all types.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/petals.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/564354)

**[toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2848604)** graces us once more with a charming rendition of Camellia's and Nanahira's latest artcore collaboration, Petals. The structure and patterns presented in the map are clean and polished, with a characteristic toybot stacking and blanketing style. 

The rhythms are given enough thought to ensure they both represent the song, as well as allowing ample variation to keep player's on the edge of their seat. Supported by a dazzling storyboard by **[Kanari](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/891115)**, this map beautifully captures the wonderful voice of Nanahira, while maintaining a secondary focus on the instrumental track of the song! Definitely deserves a place in this month's Spotlights!

While it may not be innovative, **[Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1603923)** has presented us with yet another well made map this month filled, with his nostalgia-focused design choices. What makes Delis's maps stand out from the masses of modern maps is their old-style object composition and slider design, which resemble maps from an age most current osu! players have never gotten a chance to see.

## osu!taiko

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/soumatou-labyrinth.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/625493)

The winner of the osu!taiko spotlights this month is no one else but **[komasy](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1980256)**! Soumatou Labyrinth provides an extremely solid and consistent spread from Kantan to Inner Oni which will satisfy players of any skill level. Special shoutout to the Inner Oni that makes use of very intuitive 1/6 snappings while keeping an overall high difficulty with the usage of complex rhythms, suiting the song perfectly. A well deserved first place!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/necrophagiatoast.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/567504)

While the titular practice of feasting on corpses is enough to send shivers down one's spine, a toast towards the act crosses boundaries further still. 

In this month's Spotlight, **[_yu68](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6170507)**'s Necrophagiatoast breaks new ground in more ways than one. Not only is this the first time we see Kobaryo featured in the ranked section, the mapset also possesses a difficulty with the highest star rating among ranked maps in osu!taiko, superseding Galaxy Collapse as the previous titleholder for the first time in 20 months.

Comprising of 6 difficulties ranging from Futsuu to Destructive Nightmare, this mapset is an outstanding example of how high bpm maps should be handled. In spite of the song's chaotic nature, _yu68 expertly interweaves a congruent flow into his own map, making it extremely fun and satisfying to play. This map certainly isn't one for the faint-hearted though, and will definitely give all players a real challenge!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/click-soleily-remix.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/609391)

A cool map from **[iloveyou4ever](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4964596)** this month! This approved difficulty sufficiently utilizes characteristic sound effects of Soleily present in the song as the framework for the map, making pattern arrangement clean and consistent. Streams of moderate length in the transition periods accompany the music pretty well, which add spice to the overall structure of the map. 

Slider velocity alterations are also natural and intuitive, fitting the pace of the song accordingly. You're sure to find it interesting and get some simple stream practice through playing this beatmap.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/cry-thunder.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/500752)

It's time to Cry Thunder! **[Surono](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3611370)** is storming this month's spotlights with a 1/3 and 1/6-snap filled song by DragonForce! 

Using the relatively uncommon 1/3 snap as the song's main rhythm, Surono has created a map that becomes noteworthy simply from clever utilization of this unusuaal beat snapping. Mixed together with solid drum mapping and guitar solos, he has made a very respectable entry into this month's Spotlight.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/my-so-called-life.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/627934)

Finally, three years after the first Venetian Snares song has been ranked in osu!standard, osu!taiko has finally gotten a ranked map of this breakcore artist as well, and it has proven to work very nicely.

Difficult rhythms, dense patterns, streams and various combined note snaps: My So-Called Life has everything, and **[Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2239480)** has combined them all into an amazing map. Also, don't get fooled by the long calm section in the first third of the song - the difficulty quickly ramps up as the song enters its more intense parts.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/sayonara-memories.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/606364)

**[Akemi_Homura](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/707980)** has put out a great entry into Ranked this month with Sayonara Memories! The simple 1/2 + 1/4 patterns are neatly mapped with appropriate consistency and the song parts were divided very well by patterning within the map itself, making it very interesting to play. It is also good practice for double time, since the map has many rest sections dividing the more difficult ones. There's bound to be something for everyone in this one!

## osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/fingerbang.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/559525)

The July osu!catch Spotlights start with a bang! While this set by **[JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4879508)** doesn't really edge out on the star rating, it still is a wiggly map full of twists and turns for the player to hold their finger on. With his ever-distinct style present in the map, combined with the song's fast pace and uncommon rhythms, it sure is something that players would have to carefully (finger)dash for!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/yuragi.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/602506)

Surprising us with another entry, **[JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4879508)** has given us a solid mapset that shows mastery of balanced play-ability and flow. While it may comply with the standard settings of modern mapping, this map sets itself apart with solid flow and entertainment value. Great job!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/sad-machine.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/380329)

When you think of "marathons" in osu!catch, a Platter difficulty at 88.5 BPM doesn't typically spring to mind, but **[- Magic Bomb -](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3071175)** has brought something unique and different here with just such a map. 

Despite the lower difficulty level, the map offers a wide variety of patterns and emphasis to keep the player interested over the course of almost six minutes, from short and sharp dashes on synth and percussion sounds, to long, twisting vocal-mapped sliders. Each section of the map is pitched well to the emotion and intensity of the music, resulting in a relaxing yet enjoyable experience that can provide a test of stamina to less-experienced players.

## osu!mania

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/I.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/426638)

Here we have **[Tidek](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/743282)** this time with a beatmap worthy enough for the Spotlight. Knowing that **[_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2235750)** has made 2 guest difficulties, we can expect a big and wide-reaching work from these two experienced Polish mappers. 

The best thing about this map is that you can actually appreciate how the patterns and scroll speed changes gets harder at the same time in each difficulty, if you play them from easiest to hardest. This beatmap is highly recommended if you are fan of scroll speed changes and challenging patterns. Enjoy!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/altersist.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/459950)

**[pwhk](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/4887865)** is back once again with a 7-key BMS style map. With the growing trend of fancy scroll speed changes and unique maps, sometimes it is also nice to look at maps that are kept simplistic yet deliver satisfaction. 

The beginning simple slowjam that develops with polyrhythms to the first kiai section is very satisfying to nail. The ending section may be a bit biased to favor the left hand space bar users, but this is a very solid map overall. Any pro 7K players who love some challenge should try this map with DoubleTime; the general patterning of this map is very Double Time-friendly yet offers a whole new level of difficulty.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-08-30-beatmap-spotlights-july-2017/bangin-burst.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/207525)

Just when we all thought the days of mapping SDVX songs with the SFX were over, **[Skalim](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2225008)** gives us Bangin' Burst, an older map first submitted in 2014 with a style reminiscent of its time. Good stack usage and equal hand bias creates a balanced symmetry that's easy to read and comfortable to hit. 

Furthermore, it utilizes some simple stutter SVs where appropriate. With a heavy focus on visuals as well as having some minijacks and basic LN holds and releases, the map provides a unique and varied gameplay experience.

--------

And that concludes this month's Spotlights listing. We hope that you click, drum, catch, and mash your heart out from these maps - and may you look forward to next month's installment!

Remember to play through the whole set in your given gamemode (or all of them) to nab yourself a shiny new Spotlight medal for your profile page!
