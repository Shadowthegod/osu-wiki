**Modding** é o processo de examinar o [map](PT:Beatmap "wikilink") de outra pessoa e fazer sugestões. A pessoa fazendo sugestões para o map é chamada de "modder", e a pessoa que fez o map é referida como "mapper". Modding pode ser útil de três formas:

1.  Se seu post de mod é útil ao mapper, então ele vai te dar [kudosu](PT:Kudosu "wikilink"). Kudosu pode ser usado para aumentar a prioridade de seu map ou de outro map da sua escolha.
2.  "Mod4Mod", como é chamado o acordo de fazer mods no beatmap de outra pessoa caso ela também faça no seu, é uma ótima forma de receber mods.
3.  Um bom post de mod reduz o tempo que os times de aprovação gastam mencionando erros básicos. Isso faz com que os times de aprovação fiquem menos estressados, e fiquem mais dispostos a moderar seu map. Acredite, um [BN](PT:Beatmap_Nomination_Group "wikilink") contente é melhor que um BN que ficou reclamando 10 minutos por causa de um beatmap que claramente precisava de muito mais mods.

Se você está aprendendo como mapear ou se já sabe mapear, modding pode ser uma otima forma de aprimorar suas abilidades de mapeamento.

Basic modding method
--------------------

First, download a map from the [beatmap](PT:Beatmap "wikilink") thread, which can be located in either the [Pending](PT:Pending_Beatmap "wikilink") or [Work In Progress/Help](PT:Works_In_Progress/Help "wikilink") forum (not the [Ranked](PT:Ranked_beatmap "wikilink")/[Approved](PT:Approved_Beatmap "wikilink") Beatmaps forum!). You can either randomly choose maps from these sub-forums to mod or you can open a modding queue in the **Modding Queue** sub-forum under the [Work In Progress/Help](PT:Works_In_Progress/Help "wikilink") forum and accept requests. If you are opening a queue, it is a good idea to see how these queues work by reading some threads in the 'Modding Queues' sub-forum.

Next, go into the [Editor](PT:Editor "wikilink") and select the map which you want to mod. Then, start up a reply to the [Beatmap's](PT:Beatmap "wikilink") thread.

Choose any of the difficulties to begin your mod. It is recommended to start with the easiest or hardest difficulty and make your way up or down the different difficulties.

Start by playing this difficulty in either Play mode or [test mode](PT:Glossary#Test_Mode "wikilink"). Play-testing is an important part of modding as it allows the modder to understand whether or not certain [Patterns](PT:Pattern "wikilink") play well. Take note of anything that felt odd.

After play-testing, watch the song in the editor and pause frequently to catch any errors. In this stage of modding, it is most often that modders find more intricate problems such as combo errors, hitsound inconsistencies, and areas where hit circles or sliders are missing. When you find a hit circle or a slider that needs attention, select it. Now, go to the "Edit" tab and select "Copy" at the top (or Ctrl+C), and then to your post you started up, and paste (Ctrl+V) what you just copied there. Then, follow up with either what you think is wrong (Ex. "I would change this spacing because the music does not suggest a [jump](PT:Jumps "wikilink") here), or simply that it doesn't seem right and you can't put your finger on it. Always look for things that you didn't notice while playing.

**Rinse and repeat with the next difficulty** keep in mind that if you see something while in the Editor that you didn't notice while playing, point that out too. (It is recommended to have the map play at normal speed in the Editor while you watch it, just to double check things). When you're done, submit your post.

What to look for in a beatmap
-----------------------------

A very helpful tool is AIMod, which can be opened under the "Files" tab or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+A. This shows the errors that the certain difficulty of a beatmap has. However, be wary that it is still just a computer, and some errors are not true errors (i.e. a spacing error, but there was supposed to be a jump).

The below is a list, organized by importance.

### [Timing](PT:Timing "wikilink")

The most important part of making a beatmap is timing. If the BPM is incorrect, the whole song will be timed incorrectly, and the rhythm of the notes will feel awkward. If the notes feel consistently "off," then it is most likely due to an offset issue. The offset adjusts the main beat of each measure so that it will match the main beat the music. This is likely the problem if it is hard to get good [accuracy](PT:Accuracy "wikilink") on a map. The BPM and offset must be the same in **all** difficulties. This also applies for BPM changes. All BPM changes and their correlating offset must be the same in **all** difficulties.

### [Spacing](PT:Spacing "wikilink")

One of the most important aspects of beatmapping is [spacing](PT:Spacing "wikilink"). Spacing helps the player understand the rhythm of the hitcircles better. Spacing rules can be easily broken while still having a easily readable beatmap, but doing so requires a higher level of mapping understanding. If you are a beginner modder/mapper, don't hesitate to comment on spacing, but also be weary that weird spacing can be characteristic of a [jump](PT:Jumps "wikilink"), an [anti-jump](PT:Anti-jumps "wikilink"), or a jumpy map in general.

### **Rhythm of the [PT:Hit objects](PT:Hit_objects "wikilink")**

Being that osu! is a rhythm game, sensible rhythm is very important in beatmapping. If certain notes seem to be missing that may make beatmap "flow better" or sound better, then do not hesitate to suggest doing so. If certain notes seemed to be [overmapped](PT:Overmapping "wikilink"), then do not hesitate to suggest removing it. If any sort of rhythm sounds or feels awkward while playing or while looking in [editor](PT:Editor "wikilink"), then it is likely that the hitobject may have been wrongly placed, wrongly timed, or given too short or too long of a length (e.g. sliders or spinners)

### [New Combos](PT:Combos "wikilink")

Combos in the most basic sense divide the [hit circles](PT:Hit_Object "wikilink") of a [beatmap](PT:Beatmap "wikilink") so that they are easier to read. Combos generally do not go over 20 in [Insane](PT:Insane "wikilink") difficulties, 12 in [Hard](PT:Hard "wikilink") difficulties, and 8 in [Easy](PT:Easy "wikilink") and [Normal](PT:Normal "wikilink") difficulties. There is no problem if these combos reach above the general rule if they make sense, but if there is a logical way to break up a long combo, then it is recommended to do so. Combos are usually placed to either match the vocal/musical phrases or to indicate the downbeat of each measure. In special cases, combos are used in indicating any discrepancies in spacing or slider velocity.

### '''Awkward Overlaps or Stacks

Overlaps and stacks are generally fine. However, sometimes these overlaps and stacks are repeated to an extreme extent which makes maps very hard to play. Anything hard to read because of weird shapes, overlaps, or stacks should generally be avoided and is a good thing to comment about in a mod post.

### Awkward [Slider Velocity](PT:Slider_Velocity "wikilink") Changes

Sometimes maps contain slider velocity changes that may not make much sense or are very hard to follow. If a slider velocity change requires more than just intuition to understand, then it is usually not a fitting slider velocity change. A common example of when to use a slider velocity change would be in a section of a song that is slowed down or more calming than the rest of the song. Here, many mappers would likely slow down the slider velocity to match the calmed music.

### [Hitsounds](PT:Hitsounds "wikilink")

Hitsounds are the noise the game makes when the player successfully hits a note. All maps must have a sufficient amount of hitsounding, whether using custom or default hitsounds, or else they cannot be ranked. Sometimes the hitsounds can sound awkward or weird. Other times, the hitsounds are too quiet or too loud. This may actually confuse the players. Something to be very careful about is using too low of a volume. In most cases, using a volume that cannot be heard is unrankable and is something to pay attention to.

### [Kiai Time](PT:Kiai_Time "wikilink")

Kiai Time should make sense and should not be abused. They are only for times where the music reaches some "epic" climax. In addition, Kiai Time should generally be the same in all difficulties. However, [Taiko](PT:Taiko "wikilink") [difficulties](PT:Difficulty "wikilink") may differ from regular [osu!](PT:Osu! "wikilink") standard difficulties. If the Kiai Time differ in any way, it is not a bad idea to make sure whether the Kiai Time are different on purpose or by accident.

### Difficulty Settings

The difficulty settings can be found in the Song Set-up window, opened by click F4 or the "Song Set-up" tab at the top of the [editor](PT:Editor "wikilink") screen. These are important to game play so that the song is at a fair level of [difficulty](PT:Difficulty "wikilink") for the varying difficulties a [mapset](PT:Mapset "wikilink") can have. For example, an [Easy](PT:Easy "wikilink") difficulty with not need an Approach Rate (AR) of 7 or an HP Drain Rate (HP) of 8. This is completely illogical and makes the difficulty much harder than it should be.

### [Song Setup](PT:Song_Setup "wikilink")

The actual Song Setup options do not impact game play, but it is important to give correct names. The artist name, the title of the song, the source (if applicable), and the tags should all be the same in each difficulty. Audio Lead-in times are usually the same, but can differ depending on when the first note is played. The "Enable Countdown" button should be either activated or deactivated in all difficulties.

### Background, Skin, and Combo Colours

Most importantly, all beatmaps must have a background picture. The skin should not blend in with the background or greatly hinder game play (because of complex [hitcircle](PT:Hitcircle "wikilink") design, huge [hitbursts](PT:Hitbursts "wikilink"), etc.). There are also many [Skinning](PT:Skinning "wikilink") rules which are needed to be followed. Similar to Skinning, combo colours should not blend in with the background either. These combo colours should also be very distinct and clear. The mapper should not have two almost identical combo colours (unless they are separated by a very contrasting colour in between).

### [Storyboarding](PT:Storyboarding "wikilink")

If anything weird in the storyboard happens (bad rendering of pictures, emptiness, etc.) it is a good idea to tell the storyboarder (who may or may not be the mapper) so that he or she can fix it. The Storyboard generally should not exceed an S.B. Load of 5.0x. You can check out the Storyboard by pressing F2 or clicking the "Design" tab at the top of the screen in [editor](PT:Editor "wikilink"). The dimensions of the elements should not exceed the default size.

### Preview Point

All maps must have a preview point. A preview point will be denoted by a yellow-ish line on the timeline at the bottom of the [editor](PT:Editor "wikilink"). You can also check if a map has a preview point by going into AIMod (Ctrl+Shift+A) and checking under the "Style" tab. This preview point must also be the same in all difficulties.

### File Organization

The bit rate of the song should lie between 128 to 192 kbps. Also, one empty .osb may exist but they must be deleted when more than one is present. Check if there are any file unrelated to the [beatmap](PT:Beatmap "wikilink") itself (excluding the thumb.db as this is the metafile automatically generated by the computer system).

What to avoid in your mod post
------------------------------

1.  **Vague Terms:**
    -   **[Spacing](PT:Spacing "wikilink")** When offering help to inexperienced mappers, you should explain **why** it is incorrect spacing. This will help the new mapper grasp a better understanding of beatmapping. On the other hand, more experienced mappers rarely make accidental spacing mistakes, so please explain **why** you think the spacing should be changed.
    -   **[New Combo/Remove Combo](PT:Combos "wikilink")** Many times adding new combos will help a map. However, because the modder does not explain **why**, the mapper may not understand the reason behind doing so and will not change the combo. It is always a good idea to support your suggestion with **why** it is important.
    -   **1 grid to the right** It is not always obvious **why** a hit object should be moved a grid up/right/down/left. It is fine to suggest this, but explain **why** it should be moved (typically it's to make a pattern symmetrical). This sort of suggestion, however, does not offer much to improve a beatmap. Keep in mind a mod post should not only consist of such suggestions.
    -   **This shape is ugly** Whether the shape is made of [Hitcircles](PT:Hitcircles "wikilink"), [sliders](PT:Sliders "wikilink"), or both, the mapper obviously will not understand what you are asking for. What looks aesthetically pleasing to the mapper may not always look aesthetically pleasing to you. Please understand that the osu! community comes from across the world and respect each player's opinions. Instead of stating the slider is outright ugly, it is better to say "This slider looks weird in my opinion" and then to offer an alternative (via an in-post attachment or an external link).

2.  **Offensive Language** Even if the mapper is a close friend, please try to keep the mod post clean. It is understandable that certain patterns may seem completely illogical to you, but that is not a reason for insulting the mapper. Refraining from terms such as "WTF is this?" or "This is completely stupid" can help to repress any potential argument and create a better osu! environment.

Essentially, each point of your mod post should have a **"when"**, **"what"**, and **"why"**. When you do not have the "why" or the "what", the suggestions may be a little confusing for the mapper. This, in turn, makes your mod a lot less useful than it should be. Simply explaining your suggestions will make your mod a lot more useful.
