# Community Tournaments

This is the place where tournament hosts can add a wiki page for their tournaments.

## Contributing

We don't provide a template to use since tournaments vary in structure from the official world cups. We urge you look at the world cup pages (e.g. [TWC 2017](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/blob/master/wiki/Tournaments/TWC/2017/en.md)) as a reference for how an acceptable tournament wiki page should look.

Please make sure to read the README on the [front page of this repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki) for other contributing guidelines.
